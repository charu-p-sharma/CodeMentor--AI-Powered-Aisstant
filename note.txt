FRONTEND (with TypeScript)
--------
- npm create vite@latest
- variant - TypeScript + SWC
- npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
- npm install react-icons
- npm i react-router-dom
- npm i react-hot-toast
- npm i axios (used for communication between frontend and backend api )
- npm i react-syntax-highlighter (to show code snippet)
- npm i react-type-animation (for typing text animation)

- useLayoutEffect runs before it is rendered on the UI.

// TODO
- how to identify the language js or others from the 
message of code block
 Hint - see the response of the code snippet starting word 
 is the name of the language in the chat's response, 
 so use this to find the language and mention it rather 
 than statically mentioning in the frontend code.
